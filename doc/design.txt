A packrat parser is a memoized recursive descent parser.
Memoization is performed over rules and input string position.

CharBuffer - definitely seems like the right choice for data representation
Segment - nope
String - slice duplicates substring and creates new object
StringBuffer - seems targeted at building strings, replaced by StringBuilder? (meh)

StreamTokenizer seems like the choice to suck in data, but we need to set good defaults.
